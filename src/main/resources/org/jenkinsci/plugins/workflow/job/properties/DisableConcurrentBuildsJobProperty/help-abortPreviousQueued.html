    By default, disabling concurrent builds means that new builds will queue up and wait for a running build to complete.
    With this option, scheduling a new build immediately aborts any queued build.
    This is handy for example if you have an expensive pull request testing procedure and do not wish to waste any time
    testing outdated commits but still want to finish with currently tested ones or you want to deploy as soon as possible.
